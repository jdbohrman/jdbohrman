# Hey there, I'm James 👋

<img src="./banner.png" alt="Portcullis Banner">
I'm the Founder and CEO of Portcullis, the Clickhouse solution studio for petabyte-scale ideas. I love solving problems and helping both our clients and the greater Clickhouse ecosystem build solutions that move data as fast and reliably as possible. We're a team of builders and solvers, so when we aren't doing client work, we're working on various projects on the Clickhouse ecosystem.
